All art assets were taken from various unity tutorials.
GradientLitShader was made on a previous Game Jam by me.

CONTROLS:
- WASD - Move player's ship
- Space - Shoot
- Tab - Lock target in view and change from various targets in view
- X - Cancel lock on
- H - Toggle help
- R - Restart

FEATURES:
- Custom Shader that changes object color over time
- Enemies attack when you enter in certain range

Issues:
- Sometimes the lockOn gets finicky when the target gets on the edge and/or you're shooting at him, it shouldn't happen but it does, don't know why,
if that happens simply reset the lock (with 'X' and re-enable with Tab) and it work's fine.
